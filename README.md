Liubomyr K.,

I did not do my portfolio beacuse I have no projects done that would complete my portfolio. But, I created small website that would have aircrafts photos and their short history with specs. I tried to have fun with it, so it is not completed. Only Antonov page has something to show and other pages have the body with no photos or text. I think, colors that I have picked are awful but I am not a designer and won't be. Hopefully, you enjoyed it!
